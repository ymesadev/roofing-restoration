      { type: 'paragraph', text: "If you can see daylight coming through your roof from inside your attic, you have an immediate problem. This means there's a hole or significant gap in your roofing materials, and water will follow the same path light does. Don't wait for rain to confirm this--call for tarping immediately." },
      { type: 'heading', level: 2, text: '2. Missing Shingles or Tiles' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: "Walk around your property after a storm and look at your roof from ground level. If you can see patches of exposed underlayment (usually black felt paper or synthetic material) where shingles or tiles should be, your roof is vulnerable. Even if it's not currently raining, the next weather event could cause serious water intrusion." },
      { type: 'heading', level: 2, text: '3. Active Water Intrusion' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: "This one seems obvious, but it's worth stating: if water is actively coming into your home through the roof or ceiling, you need emergency help immediately. Document the leak with photos and video, then call for emergency tarping. Place buckets to catch water and move valuables away from the affected area." },

Water and electricity are a dangerous combination.' },
      { type: 'heading', level: 2, text: '4. Ceiling Stains or Bubbling' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: "New water stains on your ceiling after a storm indicate water is getting through your roof. Similarly, paint that's bubbling or peeling, or drywall that feels soft or spongy, are signs of water accumulation. Even if you don't see active dripping, water is present and damage is occurring." },
      { type: 'heading', level: 2, text: '5. Debris Impact Damage' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: "If a tree limb, fence section, or other debris struck your roof during the storm, assume damage until proven otherwise. Impact damage can crack tiles, puncture shingles, or damage the underlying decking even when it's not immediately visible. The longer this goes unprotected, the greater the risk of water damage." },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: "If any section of your roof appears to be sagging, dipping, or deformed after a storm, this indicates structural damage. This is a serious situation that requires immediate attention--not only for water protection but for safety. Don't go into your attic to investigate; call professionals immediately." },
