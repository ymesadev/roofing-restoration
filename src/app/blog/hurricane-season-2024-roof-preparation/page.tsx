              With NOAA predicting another above-average Atlantic hurricane season, Florida homeowners need to take roof preparation seriously. The time to act is before the first storm forms, not when one is bearing down on your community.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              After 15 years of helping Florida families recover from storm damage, I&apos;ve seen firsthand how preparation makes the difference between minor repairs and catastrophic losses. Here&apos;s what you need to do now to protect your home.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The most important step you can take is having a qualified roofing professional inspect your roof before hurricane season begins. Many issues that lead to storm damage failures are invisible from the ground—loose flashing, deteriorating seals around penetrations, or shingles that have lost their adhesive bond.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              A thorough inspection should cover:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Condition of all roofing materials (shingles, tiles, or metal panels)</li>
              <li>Flashing around chimneys, vents, skylights, and roof edges</li>
              <li>Condition of the roof deck (from the attic)</li>
              <li>Gutter and drainage system functionality</li>
              <li>Soffit and fascia integrity</li>
              <li>Any signs of previous repairs that may be failing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Address Minor Issues Before They Become Major Problems</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              That small leak you&apos;ve been ignoring? That loose shingle you noticed last month? Hurricane-force winds will find every weakness in your roof. What might be a $200 repair today could become a $20,000 claim after a storm exploits it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Common pre-storm repairs include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Replacing damaged or missing shingles/tiles</li>
              <li>Re-sealing flashing and roof penetrations</li>
              <li>Securing loose ridge caps</li>
              <li>Replacing deteriorated pipe boots</li>
              <li>Clearing and repairing gutters</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. Trim Trees and Remove Debris</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Overhanging branches are one of the leading causes of roof damage during storms. Even branches that seem securely attached can become projectiles in hurricane-force winds. Have a professional tree service trim back any branches within 10 feet of your roof.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Additionally, remove any debris from your roof and gutters. Leaves, twigs, and other debris can clog drainage paths, leading to water backup and potential leaks during heavy rain.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. Document Your Roof&apos;s Current Condition</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This step is crucial for insurance purposes. Before storm season, take detailed photos and video of your roof from multiple angles. Document any recent repairs with receipts. This pre-storm documentation can be invaluable when filing a claim, as it proves the damage occurred during the storm and wasn&apos;t pre-existing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">5. Review Your Insurance Policy</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Understanding your coverage before you need it prevents unpleasant surprises. Key questions to answer:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>What is your hurricane/wind damage deductible?</li>
              <li>Does your policy cover the full replacement cost or actual cash value?</li>
              <li>Are there any exclusions or limitations you should know about?</li>
              <li>What is the claims process and timeline?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">6. Know Your Emergency Tarping Options</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Even the best-prepared roof can sustain damage in a major hurricane. Have a plan for emergency repairs before you need one. Identify reputable roofing companies that offer 24/7 emergency tarping services and save their contact information.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              After a storm, demand for emergency services skyrockets while supply is limited. Having an established relationship with a reliable contractor can mean the difference between getting help within hours versus waiting days or weeks.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Pro Tip: The 72-Hour Rule</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Most insurance policies require you to take reasonable steps to prevent further damage after a loss. This typically means getting a tarp on any exposed areas within 72 hours. Document the damage with photos before any temporary repairs, but don&apos;t delay protection.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Take Action Now</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Hurricane preparation isn&apos;t something to put off until a storm enters the Gulf. The best time to prepare was yesterday; the second best time is today. Schedule your roof inspection, address any issues found, and have your emergency plan in place before you need it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Your roof is your home&apos;s first line of defense against hurricane damage. Give it the attention it deserves, and it will protect everything underneath it when the storms come.
            </p>
